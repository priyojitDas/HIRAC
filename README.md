## HIRAC - Inferring Chromosome Radial Organization from Hi-C Data ##

The included Python scripts (mat2net.py, and predictCTpos.py) contain an implemention of the HIRAC computational technique described in the following manuscript.

Manuscript

The computational technique first generates multiple 3D network configurations from bulk Hi-C data using force-directed graph layout algorithm and then applies a regression technique to infer radial territorial positon of chromsomes inside the nucleus.

When using the Hi-C contact data as an input, the algorithm expects a square contact matrix. 

The algorithm can be executed by running the following commands in two steps - 

python mat2net.py -i GM12878-Control-R2__hg19__genome__C-2500000-iced.matrix.gz -n 100 -o test_dir

-i : input file name in .matrix.gz format
-n : number of samples (network structures)
-o : location of the output directory for generated samples

python predictCTpos.py -l GM12878-Control-R2__hg19__genome__C-2500000-iced.matrix.gz.label -n 100 -g GM12878-Control-R2__hg19__genome__C-2500000-iced.matrix.gz.gexf -t F -s test_dir 

-l : input file name in .label format (generated using the first command)
-n : number of samples (network structures)
-g : input network configuration file name in .gexf format (generated using the first command)
-t : type of nucleus shape; L for Spherical and F for Ellipsoidal
-s : location of samples as input

A sample dataset (GM12878-Control-R2__hg19__genome__C-2500000-iced.matrix.gz) has been provided, which is a processed version of GM12878 dataset generated by Sanders et al. [1].
